        <p>
            Hi! My name is Wiktoria and I am a UI designer an Illustrator originally from Poland, based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. I am very passionate and enthusiastic about my work. Always looking for new inspiration and fresh ideas. I love minimalism and simplicity in my designs. I enjoy working with colour and creating fun and exciting designs. I worked on projects that include Web Design, UX Design, UI Design, Iconography and Illustration. I never limit myself to my computer, I love working on paper using pens, markers, pencils and paintbrushes just as much as using my digital tools.  Love for what I do is a key to my designs. I am a dog lover and food enthusiast. I enjoy taking long walks observing nature in it's finest. I am currently studying in Belfast Scool of Arts. In the future I see myself working and doing what I love at the same time.

	<h3>Branding</h3> 
	
	<p>I have decided to design my own brand. I started of with designing my own monogram, wordmark and a visual mark. Starting with sketching many ideas on to paper and than transferring them on to the screen using Illustrator. I wanted to keep the same colour sceme and theme throughout this whole project. I had to use my illustration skills and typography design to create my monogram and visual mark. For the monogram I created this bold design of 'WB' Which will be used on formal aspects of my brand, like letters, bussiness card etc. The challenges that I faced while designing the monogram were transferring the idea from paper and making it exactly the same on illustrator. This did not end up happening and I had to tweak my idea. The visual mark I wanted to be playful and fun with a clear representation of myself, so I decided to do a self portrait. I kept it simple an clean with limiting myself to the colours of my monogram. I used Adobe Illustrator to design this icon of myself. I worked from a photo of myself to trasfer enough detail and show the reablence. This will be used throughout my website, and more fun aspect of the brand. For the brand I designed my brand guidelines to make sure any elements of the brand are used correctly eg. colour scheme, layout, and where to apply them. </p>
	
	
	<h3>App Design</h3>
	
	<p>For this project I came up with a new travel app concept. The app is designed for traveling with your pets. I am a massive dog lover so I decided to design an app that helps people to travel with their dearest pets. I wireframing ideas on to paper with different icon ideas, thinking about the name and layout of the app. After I decided on the layout and idea for the design I moved on to using Adobe Illustrator. I wanted the colour palette to be fun and happy reminding the users of sunny holidays. The palette thst I chose was shades of mint green and pops of yellow. For the main app icon I decided to design  dogs paw with a world globe negative space inside of the paw. I wanted this app to be very illustrative with good UX design. The first screen is for the user to search what City they are visiting. When you enter the city a paw appears on the world globe to show where you are going on the map. The second screen brings the user to yhe illustration of the cite and three icons you can choose from for activities, hotels, and food. Each of these icons will show pet friendly options for the user, as shown in screen three. This shows the hotels in the city area that are pet friendly. When you click on to a specific hotel it brings you to screen four where it shows more information about the hotel and where you can book a room. In screen five is another section of the app which is users profile where they can keep nots on their travels and also add their favourite destinations, activities,or restaurants they have visited.   </p>
	
	
	<h3>Data Visualisation</h3>
	
	<p>In this project I wanted to focus on 'Endangered Animals'. I designed an Infographic poster to represent data visualisation. Before I even started sketching or the design aspect, I jumped into research. I started researching the most endangered species and taking noteson the data that I have found. After I have found all the data I need I started woreframing my ideas for the poster layout. For the colours I wanted the poster to feel very earth like and desert like. It was very important to me that the information is well presented so it is clear and easy to understand, as that is the purpose of Infographic posters. In the title of 'Endangered Species' I have added a different text colour to 'danger' to bring attention to it. Orange is a colour that brings attention but is not as intense as red which I think works perfectly with the purpose of this design. I used Adobe Illustrator to create all the icons and illustrations on this poster separately and then when I had all elements finished I started puting them all together. At the end of the design process I added all the text that i pre-wrote. FOr the data visualisation I have used are bar charts, line graph, pie/donut chart, and an illustrative chart. </p>
